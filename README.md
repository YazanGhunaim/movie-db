# Introduction
As the first two weeks of university passed, I quickly recognized that the demands of my coursework would limit the time I could allocate to my personal projects. In light of this, I decided to challenge myself with one final project - to create a (reasonably) fully functional full-stack application in the shortest time possible. The result? An application developed in just under 24 hours!

# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project serves as a testament to the rapid development capabilities achievable when driven by passion and determination. It showcases my ability to conceive, design, and implement a full-stack application within a tight timeframe, while maintaining functionality and quality.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1- Demonstrate rapid development skills.

2- Showcase proficiency in full-stack application development.

3- Highlight the ability to produce a functional and reasonably polished product within 24 hours.

4- Maintan standards in clean architecture and design.
